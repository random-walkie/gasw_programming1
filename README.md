Programming 1 module focusing on Java fundamentals and object-oriented design.

## Week 2 Objectives
- Set up Java project structure (src/out), compile and run.
- Implement basic classes with fields, constructors, and methods.
- Practice encapsulation (private fields, getters/setters).
- Create simple shape classes (e.g., Circle, Square, Triangle).
- Write a main class to instantiate objects and call methods.
